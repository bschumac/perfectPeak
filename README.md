## The perfect peak

Actually we need an straightforward example for using GIS software. A very nice and apparently simple one is the idea that one is able to calculate a value of **independence** for any mountain. This means more ore less a ranking of perfect peaks. What is the background? Christian Rauch has written an article in the magazine of the German Alpine Club (DAV) to give a solution of this burning problem of most of the mountaineers \cite{Rauch2012}. 

It seems to be a simple approach but then it turns out into a almost arbitrarily complex spatial problem. And very suitable for our needs it is not charged with any scientific claims. So we will start and try to understand the problem.

The perfectPeak package is the implementation of the different algorithms in R.
